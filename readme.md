- Improve accessibility (speedpage insights says Document does not have a main landmark)

### Done

- Add PostHog
- Mobile formatting
- Make mobile work? (debatable if important)
- Get custom domain
- Deploy to vercel
- 'Copied!' text replaces the image when IP address is successfully copied
- Clicking the copy button also copies the ip address then displays text
- 'Copied' success text changes back to clickable icon 2 seconds later
- Change from png to svg for copy icon
